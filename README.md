## Hello World 🌎

Its me, Davonne here..! Night owl developer making my way to land my first role in tech.  
Although I am a developer, I love design. I can't get away from it. It brings me joy
to bring a desin to life. I want to build what others design and I really like the 
concept of the bridging the gap between design and code. 

My Github consists of projects I built along this jouney, from being self taught, to a
Coding Bootcamp, to today owning my craft. From serious projects, to projects for fun,
I enjoy coding and plan to keep growing as a Developer. 

- 💻 I am currently building sites for local small businesses
- ✨ Learning TypeScript, React.js, and forever a JavaScript learner  
- 💡 My goals include Backend to build Fullstack Apps and learning more about AI because I have a feeling its here to stay.
  This is a journey and I'm enjoying the ride.
