## Welcome World 🌎

My name is Davonne, I am a Frontend Web Developer building UI Projects, leaning towards the UI/UX route
, as well as in pursuit working my way to Fullstack Development. My Github consists of projects I built
along this jouney, from being self taught, to a Coding Bootcamp, to today owning my craft, and building
skills to land a role. From serious projects, to projects for fun, I enjoy coding and plan to keep
growing as a Dev and expanding my knowledge.
