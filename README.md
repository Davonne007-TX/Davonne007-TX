## Hello World 🌎

My name is Davonne, I am a Frontend Web Developer staying focused learning the neccessary skills to land a role. Although I am a developer, I love design. I can't get away from it. I want to build what others design and I really like the concept of the bridge between deign and code. 

My Github consists of projects I built along this jouney, from being self taught, to a Coding Bootcamp, to today owning my craft. From serious projects, to projects for fun, I enjoy coding and plan to keep growing as a Developer.

- ✨ I am currently learning TypeScript, React.js, and forever a JavaScript learner  
- 💡 My goals include learning Express.js, Node.js, Next.js, and everything else. This is a journey and I'm enjoying the ride.
